These are the files used in Destroy All Software production 0102, "Data
Compressor From Scratch", available at:

    https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/data-compressor-from-scratch

The files are:

- RUNME.sh, which wasn't used in the screencast, but exists to give you an
  easy way to run this code and see it work. You can execute it via
  `./RUNME.sh` (without the backquotes).

- garyzip.rb, which is the file written in the screencast.

- bin.rb, which defines BinPacker and BinUnpacker, responsible for packing
  sequences of int8s, int16s (unused in the screencast), int32s, and arbitrary
  bits into bytes.

- rendertree.rb, which provides the `render_tree` function used to show the
  Huffman coding trees visually.

- tree.dot, a manually-created tree diagram shown at the beginning of the
  screencast. You can render it via `dot -Tpng tree.dot | ./imgcat` (requires
  iTerm 2 or a terminal implementing iTerm 2's PNG rendering escape codes).

- imgcat, which is distributed by the authors of iTerm 2 but included here for
  convenience. It allows us to print PNGs to the terminal. It will only work
  with iTerm 2 or other terminals that implement iTerm 2's PNG rendering
  escape codes.

DEPENDENCIES

- Ruby 2.4.1 (or probably older or newer versions, but try 2.4.1 if anything
  goes wrong).
- For the tree rendering, iTerm 2 version 3.0.15.
